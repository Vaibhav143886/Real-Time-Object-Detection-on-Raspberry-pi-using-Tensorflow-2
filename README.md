# Real-Time-Object-Detection-on-Raspberry-pi-using-Tensorflow-2
Applying Object Detection Algorithm on devices like raspberry pi can be difficult especially when real time object detection is to be performed.

1. Image Collection Jupyter Notebook: Set Up Files and Floder and used to collect dataset, label and annotate using bounding boc Technique.
2. Training and Detection Jupyter Notebook: Set up Tensorflow files, installation of Tensorflow, pre-trained model
